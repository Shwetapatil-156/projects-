Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting. This recipe is cheap and tasty.","1":"Authentic Italian-style risotto cooked the slow and painful way, but oh so worth it. Complements grilled meats and chicken dishes very well. Check the rice by biting into it. It should be slightly al dente (or resist slightly to the tooth but not be hard in the center).","2":"Essential crepe recipe.  Sprinkle warm crepes with sugar and lemon, or serve with cream or ice cream and fruit.","3":"My mom came up with this recipe when I was a child. It is the ONLY way I will eat green onions.","4":"This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.  You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!!  It yields a soft, chewy crust.  For a real treat, I recommend you use bread flour and bake it on a pizza stone, but all-purpose flour works well too. Enjoy!","5":"My version of chicken parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.","6":"Hot jumbo buttermilk biscuits with creamy sausage gravy are ready in just 15 minutes for a hearty, family-favorite breakfast.","7":"This is a nice rich mac and cheese.  Serve with a salad for a great meatless dinner. Hope you enjoy it.","8":"Makes great cookies!","9":"If you want to make a good pizza that's fast and easy, this is it. Cooking at a higher temperature (500 degrees F (260 degrees C)) is the key to making this the perfect pizza. It doesn't get any easier than this folks. Brush dough with olive oil and add your favorite toppings. Enjoy!","10":"If you love good, old fashioned mashed potatoes this is the perfect recipe. Simple and delicious.","11":"Tender dark-meat chicken thighs and drumsticks baked in a rich, creamy white sauce.","12":"These are great for outdoor grilling. Simple and very tasty. The glaze at the end gives them a lot of concentrated flavor.","13":"Quick and easy sugar cookies! They are really good, plain or with candies in them. My friend uses chocolate mints on top, and they're great!","14":"A lovely, crispy waffle perfect for the morning.","15":"This is my husband's favorite dish, and he considers it a special occasion every time I make it. The creamy cheese sauce and the tender potatoes in this classic French dish combine to make a deliciously addictive experience. It's a great side dish with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin. Add a green salad and French bread, and you have found the magic path to a man's heart. To avoid lumps in your sauce, add the milk just a little at a time as you stir the flour and butter. Experiment with different cheeses for variety.","16":"This is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time it's made me famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.","17":"My mother was a country cook, plain and simple. But as I have traveled and worked and experienced foods from around the world, I look back and realize that many of the dishes she prepared, while simple, were perfect for that moment. Sometimes we have to put emotion and love in a dish to make it extra-special. The dish I am going to give you today is one like that. Simple and easy, yet full of love and goodness. My mother used to serve this with corn on the cob and cornbread. Very inexpensive and very good as well. Enjoy an Ozark memory...","18":"My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before","19":"Easy taco lettuce wraps.","20":"Sweet apples plus savory bacon equals a perfect quiche. We added a whole chopped poblano pepper last time and it complemented it very well.","21":"This is a famous dish popularized in Thailand. Although the recipe varies from cook to cook and region to region, this is a good attempt at recreating what I ate from Thai-owned hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Okinawa, Japan. Key to the flavor are the sugar levels, unsalted peanuts, peanut oil, and either oyster or fish sauce.","22":"This is a salad that everyone seems to love. I always get lots of compliments on this recipe and it is just a pleasing taste that seems to suit everyone.","23":"Kielbasa, also called kielbasy or Polish sausage, is a spicy sausage usually made with pork (though beef is sometimes added). It comes in chunky links, and is sold precooked. I haven't met anyone yet who didn't like this dish. I even like it and I really don't care for kielbasa that much! Another bonus is that it is easy to make, and is yet another recipe for your slow cooker.","24":"If you want the yummy taste of a slowly baked potato but aren't patient enough, or don't have the know-how to bake it in an oven, this is for you. Give it 12 minutes and get a mouth-watering, taste bud-tingling treat.","25":"The best no bake banana pudding you will ever find (or so I've been told by many).","26":"This is a very refreshing drink!","27":"Quick and easy casserole everyone will love.","28":"These oatmeal cookies are very moist with a good flavor. Add a cup of raisins or nuts if you desire.","29":"I use this as a basic baked chicken recipe when another recipe calls for cooked chicken. Works great for everything and is super customizable. Sometimes I use garlic salt or other seasonings, depending on what I'm using it for.","30":"This cake was sent home from our children's school. It is the simplest, great tasting cake I've ever made. Great to make with the kids, especially for cupcakes.","31":"This easy banana bread recipe is quick to prepare, and everyone always comes back for seconds!","32":"Wonderful pasta salad. So different from the Italian dressing pasta salads. Very hearty side dish or main dish for lunch. Crunchy veggies and rich pesto sauce.","33":"A quick fried rice like you get at your favorite Chinese restaurant. A couple of eggs, baby carrots, peas and soy sauce is all you need.","34":"This cake is made with three layers: Cake, filling, and topping.  There are 4 types of milk in the filling and topping (whole milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and heavy cream).  This is an excellent cake for milk lovers!","35":"These easy-to-fix pork chops are deliciously tender with wonderful flavor. A perfect meal for those busy afternoons when you want a quick meal that tastes like you slaved all day over the stove. Serve with rice or mashed potatoes.","36":"These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin.  Add extra blueberries too, if you want!","37":"How to make basic whipped cream. For best results make sure whisk and bowl are ice cold.","38":"If you know someone from Buffalo, they know someone who told them the secret ingredients to the Anchor Bar's famous Buffalo chicken wings. I know people from Buffalo. This is my version, as described to me many years ago, over almost as many beers.","39":"Homemade chicken soup - but you don't have to be sick to deserve or enjoy it - you do, so do! Good for body and soul!","40":"This is a great recipe to make your own fajita seasoning. No bouillon cubes means this is perfect for vegetarians too!  Make up a larger batch and store in an airtight container for future use.","41":"This is a recipe that I created by modifying my mother's recipe. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur and he scrapes the pan every time! I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health conscious. Enjoy!","42":"When I was growing up, my mom never ever made meatloaf and I always wanted to try it - I finally tried it at a restaurant and loved it. When I moved out on my own I started experimenting with different recipes and creating my own version. I finally came up with the best meatloaf I have ever made, and I wanted to share it.","43":"Only fresh green beans and garlic will do for this easy, healthy, and flavorful side dish.","44":"My mother-in-law gave me this quick and easy recipe for the sweetest, tastiest corn cobs!","45":"These cookies are the pinnacle of perfection! If you want a big, fat, chewy cookie like the kind you see at bakeries and specialty shops, then these are the cookies for you!","46":"This is my grandmother's Cuban picadillo (ground beef hash\/chili) recipe which is usually served with white rice, beans and plantains. Picadillo also goes great with mashed potatoes and can be made without the squash. This dish is a favorite at home so I usually make 2 pounds to have leftovers for making empanadas (meat pies) the next day. Picadillo also freezes well. Of course my kids say this is the best picadillo they've ever had and I have to agree!","47":"Who says eating your morning oatmeal has to be boring? Try these blended baked oats made with banana, egg, and almond milk. A really ripe banana adds sweetness. It reminds me of a muffin. The flavor possibilities are endless, but I've included my favorites in the footnotes. You can leave out the egg, but it won't be as fluffy.","48":"This tangy, creamy dip tastes just like Buffalo chicken wings. It's best served hot with crackers and celery sticks. Everyone loves the results!","49":"Tall and fluffy.  These pancakes are just right.  Topped with strawberries and whipped cream, they are impossible to resist.","50":"These are a low calorie nutritious snack. Like potato chips, you cannot stop at just eating one. They are great for parties and a good conversation topic.","51":"These spring rolls are a refreshing change from the usual fried variety, and have become a family favorite.  They are great as a cool summertime appetizer, and are delicious dipped in one or both of the sauces.","52":"Butternut squash is so good on its own, that barely any seasoning is needed. This recipe is so simple and easy.","53":"Tart, rich and perfection, all rolled into one! Wow your friends with this simple recipe.  Hint: No Substitutions!","54":"These delicious banana muffins are easy for kids to make.","55":"Takes about 45 minutes to make.","56":"This recipe delivers a basic cream cheese frosting using just butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla.","57":"This is the recipe my mother used for sloppy joes and it always gets compliments!","58":"Uses ingredients you might have on hand to whip up for fish sticks or fish and chips.","59":"This recipe has been handed down from my mother.  It is a family favorite and will not be replaced! (Definite husband pleaser!)","60":"Cooking your rib tips in a slow cooker will give you tender, falling-off-the-bone ribs. Then finish them off under the broiler or throw them on the grill for a few minutes.","61":"Succulent pork roast with fragrant garlic, rosemary and wine.","62":"These honey mustard chicken thighs are quick, easy, and taste a little bit sweet!","63":"The combination of picante sauce and chicken broth makes this easy recipe very tasty!","64":"This entree is easy and delicious!  It's one of my husband's favorites! Try to use the largest chicken breasts you can find so you'll be able to roll them easier.","65":"A frosty blender full of strawberry-citrus slush. You will enjoy this with or without the rum!","66":"This is my mom's recipe for Rice Pudding. It's the best I've ever tasted and it gets rave reviews from everyone I serve it to. Sprinkle with nutmeg or cinnamon, if desired. For creamier pudding, use short or medium grain rice.","67":"A simple soy sauce and brown sugar marinade, with hints of lemon and garlic, are the perfect salty-sweet complement to rich salmon fillets. Even my 9 year old loves this recipe!","68":"These salmon patties are delicious for lunch or dinner.","69":"Flavorful and moist baked chicken.","70":"This is the moistest banana bread that I have ever tasted. It's also very easy to make!","71":"This is a no-nonsense recipe for corn on the cob. Perfect for when you run out of stove or grill space. I freeze the corn on the cob in plastic bags, and remove a single ear of frozen corn in the cold winter months to have the sweet taste of summer corn throughout the year!","72":"This recipe is from my mother. It may sound strange, but these are really good and very easy to make. The Brussels sprouts should be brown with a bit of black on the outside when done. Any leftovers can be reheated or even just eaten cold from the fridge. I don't know how, but they taste sweet and salty at the same time!","73":"This is a very fun recipe to follow, because Grandma makes it sweet and simple. This pie is thickened with cornstarch and flour in addition to egg yolks, and contains no milk.","74":"I modified Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies very slightly. I came up with something that my boyfriend went CRAZY over! I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I blew his mother's recipe away.","75":"A quick and easy dish to prepare, this chicken stir-fry is packed with veggies. Try adding bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, snap peas, or any of your favorite vegetables. Serve it with white or brown rice, or noodles.","76":"Crowd pleasing banana pancakes made from scratch. A fun twist on ordinary pancakes.","77":"This is a super speedy dinner I like to make when it is getting late and I haven't cooked yet. Chili, corn chips and cheese are topped with lettuce and tomato. Spice it up with your favorite salsa. Vegetarian chili can be found with the regular chili - it is often labeled as 'fat free'. This recipe can easily be doubled, and cooked in a 9x13 inch baking dish.","78":"This is a really good recipe for spicy Indian chicken curry. It's pretty easy to make and tastes really good!","79":"A hearty, savory slow cooker stew with potatoes, carrots, celery, broth, herbs and spices. You won't be slow to say 'yum'!","80":"Found this recipe in Pennsylvania Amish country.  Everyone who tries it, loves it!","81":"If you like sweet cornbread, this is the recipe for you! My mom made this for me as a child, and now it's my family's favorite.","82":"This basic chicken salad is a family favorite. I like to use baked thighs or breasts that have been sprinkled with basil or rosemary.","83":"Got this from a coworker who made these for the office holiday potluck. Collard greens are cooked all day with ham shanks and pickled jalapeno. Yum!","84":"This is potato salad the old-fashioned way, with eggs, celery and relish. It's really good to serve with chili.","85":"This is a tuna casserole that even my picky family loves! The potato chips give the casserole a crunchy crust.","86":"No two spaghetti aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.","87":"I have used it often. It's easy and uses pantry staples. Always a hit with adults and kids. Serve with basmati rice or quinoa and steamed or roasted vegetables.","88":"I experimented with this until I found a quick, cheap, and easy Alfredo sauce combination -- the secret is cream cheese!","89":"Simple syrup is a commonly used ingredient in many cocktails and other drink recipes. It's also easy to make!","90":"A casserole dish of seasonal vegetables that is so easy to prepare. It can be made a day ahead - just reheat before serving. Lemon juice can be substituted for balsamic vinegar, and you can use baking potatoes if you don't have any Yukon Golds on hand.","91":"Simple appetizer - the balsamic vinegar gives it a little kick. Best if the mixture has 1 or 2 hours to blend flavors before serving.","92":"This is a wonderful side dish for any Mexican dinner.","93":"My family LOVES bread pudding, and this recipe is one that I have fine tuned to their taste. I have to double this recipe, and bake it in a 9x13 inch pan for my family!  It's great for breakfast or dessert and is delicious with milk poured on top! Enjoy!","94":"This mixture of orange juice, soy sauce, and garlic gives this marinade a wonderful taste.","95":"Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make, and since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef\/half-pork mixture. You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred.","96":"This garlic asparagus dish is a Northern Italian side dish.  My family loves it!  Even the kids!","97":"If you are sick and tired of mash potatoes, fries, chips and all the other ways potatoes are prepared but don't have the time for a complicated roasted vegetables dish than this is an easy and flavorful way to get 'er done.","98":"This is an actual recipe from a former employee of a popular drive-in restaurant. Crispy coated onion rings like the pro's make!","99":"This recipe doesn't require much thought early in the morning, and tastes great!","100":"A dear friend gave me this recipe many years ago and I've been making it ever since. It's great for barbecues.","101":"This is an oh-so-good recipe. Just the right amount of spice to make you take a cold drink but definitely keep coming back for more! This soup is irresistible!","102":"Quick and easy. I make this on my busiest weeknights.","103":"This recipe has just 3 ingredients. It's fast, easy and the cookies are wonderful! It's great for kids that are just learning to bake.","104":"Super amazing banana bread. Moist and tasty!","105":"Hearty ham and bean soup. Easy to make and a great way to use a leftover ham bone. This soup also has lots of mixed vegetables.","106":"My mom used to make this easy recipe every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! It was our very favorite Thanksgiving vegetable. If you have children, or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish! Even though I rarely cook with canned condensed soups, I still make this yummy broccoli casserole during the holiday season. It's fabulous with a Christmas ham and potatoes au gratin too. Mmmmmmm!","107":"Better than the typical poppers.","108":"This is my own version of the chocolate microwave mug cake. This chocolaty fudgy treat is truly decadent and great for nights when I need a yummy dessert that is ready in less than 10 minutes! Chocolate chips make this recipe even better.","109":"This recipe has been in my family for years. It's easy to cook, but tastes like it took hours to make! I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes. YUM!","110":"Quick, 45-minute marinade steak, pan-seared with cast iron, finished in oven directly on cast iron skillet.","111":"Quick and easy pico de gallo that is a great app or addition to dinner. Huge hit in my house!","112":"Delicious Spanish flan, everyone will love it!","113":"The special thing about this recipe is that it's so simple. Fresh asparagus with a little oil, salt, and pepper is cooked quickly over high heat on the grill. Enjoy the natural flavor of your veggies.","114":"I made these up years ago and have been making them ever since. They are always a big hit. These potatoes make a wonderful side dish for any meal and are terrific heated up the next day for lunch.","115":"No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. Baste frequently with your favorite barbeque sauce. If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms patties that hold their shape.","116":"These small, delicious sandwiches are perfect for any party. They are so good that even the pickiest of eaters will eat these.","117":"This cocktail's origin has nothing to do with Moscow or mules, but after a few sips of this vodka, ginger beer, and lime concoction, no one will care.","118":"This is a quick Garam Masala (Indian spice) mix. Garam Masala is better when made with whole spices that have been roasted and ground, but this is a quick and easy substitute that's pretty good.","119":"A wonderful baked chicken recipe that's quick and easy! Using just a few handy ingredients, create a delicious main dish, that also makes great leftovers - if there are any! Serve with a salad and pasta or rice for a quick, scrumptious dinner.","120":"This recipe will turn liver haters into converts.  Very simple! The three things that will set your liver above all others are: 1) soak in milk, 2)turn liver as little as possible and 3) don't overcook!","121":"Vanilla is the king of ice cream flavors. This version without eggs ('American' or 'Philadelphia-style') has a brighter, more pronounced vanilla flavor.","122":"Here is my recipe for the perfect sushi rice. You can eat this alone or roll into your favorite sushi roll with ingredients of choice. I use strips of carrots, cucumbers and slices of avocado. You can adjust the amount of vinegar in this recipe to suit your taste.","123":"This is my variation of panzanella. Each ingredient having its own intense flavor, when combined, creates an explosive salad. Perfect for a summer day.","124":"No more dry corned beef!
